### Technical
- The following webpages are added to the portfolio: Homepage, Biography, Projects, and Contact.
- To track the working of the project and the changes made on each step, I used Git as the version 
  controller. I have made several changes creating the developer branch and I can see those changes on Git.
- The portfolio project is pushed to the remote Git repository. The project is deployed on Github where 
  we can make changes by navigating the directory that contains the deployed website.
- Use media queries for responsive design so that the design can be effectively visible on desktop, 
  mobile phone, and any other device as per the screen size.
- To define different parts of the HTML page, sematic HTML tags like: <header>, <nav>, <article> are used.

### Bonus
- Button containers are used in CSS files defining the cursor shape, color on select, color on and after 
  hover. Those containers are reused in html file.
  - Javascript code is used to include the hamburger menu.
